Web3 Ads for Roblox!

Roblox Ads is a decentralized service designed to help digital advertisers get paid for driving engagement and attracting users to their servers.
The service works by sending data gathered from a Roblox game environment using two Lua scripts to a Node.js backend, which connects the data to a smart contract.
Once a player fulfills two conditions, namely interacting with a target advertisement for 2 seconds, and later in the day, engaging with the advertised server for 5 minutes, the smart contract initiates and rewards the advertiser from the developer's wallet.
