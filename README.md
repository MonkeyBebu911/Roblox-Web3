Web3 Ads for Roblox!

Roblox ads is a decentralized service designed to help digital advertisers get paid for gathering engagement and users to their servers. 
The service works by sending data gathered from a roblox game enviroment using two lua scripts to a Node.js backend which connects the data to a smart contract.
Once a player fulfills two conditions, namely interacting with a target advertisement for 2 seconds, and then later in the day, engaging with the server being advertised for 5 minutes. The smart contract initiates and rewards the advertiser from the developers wallet.
